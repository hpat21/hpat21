## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi everyone! My name is Harsh Patel, and my coding journey started when I was 12. I began with visual programming in Scratch, which sparked my interest in software development. As I grew older, I taught myself Python and Java, allowing me to build small projects and enhance my problem-solving skills. By 13, I was creating custom Minecraft mods and plugins, diving deep into Java's capabilities. During my high school years, I discovered game development with Unity, where I learned C# and developed interactive games. Nowadays, I am fascinated by Web Development, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and diving into frameworks like Node.js and React. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies to broaden my horizons. Hope you enjoy my projects and feel free to collaborate!
